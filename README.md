A simple, yet complex and highly functional website I built while learning Flask. It includes proper database management and handling, outh authorization, a smpt 'forgot password?' password retrival email system, pagination, blueprints, and the help of several useful Flask modules such as wtforms, itsdangerous, bcrypt, flask_sqlalchemy, and more.

Haven't included an essential config.py file here for privacy reasons.

Snippets of the application presented below -

P.S. wrote a Python script which automated the proccess of registering new test-users to the wesite and creating and uploading blogs, in order to check the functionaly of the website.
